<div class="info">
<p>We wondered what we can do to keep children from developing countries in school. Well that's the question we all set out to answer here the last couple of days. We made it our goal to come up with an elegant solution that does rely on technology while keeping costs lower in order for it to be more realistic for NGOs to afford implementing it. But we were also ambitious and knew that focusing on a global scale was of the upmost importance.

    When we looked at the numbers of global dropout rates we found out that “Sub-Saharan Africa sees 42% of its pupils leaving school early, and 33% of southern and western Asian students also drop out” - So we also made it our goal to make it implementable on a large scale, that way places where technology might be a little more available can benefit of a wider array of tools without neglecting those who don't have so much.
We want to create a system where all the children at a certain school is given a Proximity silicone wristbrand with a chip inside. When arriving at school the pupils confirm their attendance by scanning the chip in their bracelet. A bracelet is not to easy to loose and might be fashionable amongst the pupils.
